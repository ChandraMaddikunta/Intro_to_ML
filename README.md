# Intro_to_ML

This repository holds the code for the forthcoming book "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Andreas Mueller and Sarah Guido. You can find details about the book on the O'Reilly website.

This repository provides the notebooks from which the book is created, together with the mglearn library of helper functions to create figures and datasets.

All datasets are included in the repository, with the exception of the aclImdb dataset, which you can download from the page of Andrew Maas. See the book for details.

This repository is my weekly practice repository for the code from the book "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Andreas Mueller and Sarah Guido.
